Todo
----

-0.1 check if it compiles with kdepimlibs 4.5/kdepim-runtim 4.4
-data
  - friend lists
    - as contact groups or as collections?
  - events
    - participants
    - friend's events??
    - 0.1 add checkboxes "show declined events" "show maybe events"
    - add attendance label + "change attendence" link
    - rsvp, participants management
      - requires resource-specific incidence editor plugin (talk to openchange guys, they also need that)
  - messages
    - inbox, outbox
    - add "reply with facebook" button and blurb explaining that native replying will not work
      - in reply to: invalid@whatever
      - real reply would require resource-specific transport, like in openchange
    - use recipients and dates
    - group thread with one thread leader
    - propagate unread/read status back to FB
    - make deletions work
    - x-face headers in the absence of photo linking via email addresses
    - attachments
      - photos as real attachments
      - links inline (HTML)
  - feeds
    - show in Kontact summary
      - checkbox "show in kontact summary"
      - also provide plasma app
      - what about settings, simply open resource settings?
      - ability to filter wall posts
  - notes
- 0.1 translations
  - messages.sh
  - poke tsgdeos so that scripty can run
- 0.1 automatically sync every x minutes setting
  - not when offline
- offline support / cache policies / parts
- faster friend sync
  - run photo jobs in parallel
- button "add kopete account"
- make libkfacebook static
- plasma silk wizard (talk to sebas)
- set proper resourcec status when not authenticated
- push notifications
  - especially for news feed -> nice animation when item appears
- add option "don't remove deleted data"
	-> e.g. when the user adjusts privacy settings, don't locally
           delete the birthday
- 0.1 Better authentication
    - when authentication fails because access token is rejected, show more user-friendly error message,
      including instructions on how to fix that.
    - pop up on first sync if the access token is empty, with "don't ask again" option
- own kpart for messages, invite replies and so on (check what facebook mobile can do!)

Bugs
----

- 0.1: retrieveItem() for events not implemented
- switching to "broken" status after an authentication error does not work, something overwrites the status
- If only the city is set in the address, KAddressbook shows a superflous comma
- creates tons of debug areas in kdebugdialog. akonadi_facebook_resource_1 .. 2392
- Size of facebook webpage doesn't fit dialog and scrollbars are shown
- 0.1 No support for "year not set" in KAddressbook -> birthday appears in year 1900
  - add birthday year patch to repo should maintainer decline it
- timezone doesn't work

Refactor
--------

- refactor facebookresource.cpp. It is getting big, and the function names are friends-only
- common base class for eventjob and friendjob


Roadmap
-------

0.1: read-only events
0.2: newsfeed (kontact summary plugin)
0.3: read-only messages
0.4: write events
0.5: notes
