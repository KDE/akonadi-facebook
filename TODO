Bugs
----

- The country is not always a country, find a better field? (e.g. Ontaria instead of Canada in one case)
- changed items not updated on the client side
- Size of facebook webpage doesn't fit dialog and scrollbars are shown
- No support for "year not set" in KAddressbook -> birthday appears in year 1900
