- 0.1 Syncing the Facebook resource freezes up Kontact in 4.4.x
    - Bug in the Facebook resource: The item revision is incremented every sync,
      probably because the payload changes (for example DTSTAMP for events)
      This might be a limitation in the ResourceBase sync code.
    - After a sync, the Kontact summary updates itself for each changed item, leading to many
      costly updates that freeze the GUI
    - To fix this problem, the updated_time could be compared with the timestamp
      attribute, however a bug in Facebook prevents this.
    - Possible workaround in Kontact: Limit updates of the summary to only update each 15 seconds or
      so
- 0.1 QJSon not installed -> weird CMake error
- 0.1 retrieveItem() for events not implemented
- switching to "broken" status after an authentication error does not work, something overwrites the status
- If only the city is set in the address, KAddressbook shows a superflous comma
- creates tons of debug areas in kdebugdialog. akonadi_facebook_resource_1 .. 2392 (general Akonadi problem, report)
- Size of facebook webpage doesn't fit dialog and scrollbars are shown
- 0.1 No support for "year not set" in KAddressbook -> birthday appears in year 1900
  - add birthday year patch to repo should maintainer decline it
- timezone doesn't work (report bug)
